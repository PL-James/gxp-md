# GxP.MD
> GxP compliance instructions for AI coding agents

GxP.MD is a markdown-based compliance instruction standard for AI-assisted
software development in regulated pharmaceutical and life sciences industries.
It defines a single file (GxP.MD) placed at a project root that instructs
AI coding agents on GxP compliance requirements.

## Specification
- [Full Specification](https://gxp.md/spec): The complete GxP.MD v3.0.0 standard
- [Getting Started](https://gxp.md/getting-started): How to add GxP.MD to your project
- [Templates](https://gxp.md/templates): Downloadable starter files
- [Regulatory Profiles](https://gxp.md/profiles): Pre-built compliance configurations

## Key Concepts (v3.0.0)
- Annotation-first compliance — traceability lives in structured code annotations
- Develop/Harden two-mode system — lightweight during development, formalized per sprint
- Gate enforcement over process enforcement — defines what must be true, not how to work
- DAG-based traceability — edge tags (@gxp-satisfies, @gxp-implements, @gxp-verifies, @gxp-derives-from) declare relationships as a directed acyclic graph
- Opaque IDs — artifact identifiers (REQ-NNN, US-NNN, SPEC-NNN) carry no hierarchy; relationships are explicit via edge tags
- Many-to-many relationships — a single source file may satisfy multiple requirements; a single test may verify multiple specs
- Graph reachability coverage — traceability completeness is measured by reachability from requirements to tests through the DAG
- Risk-proportionate enforcement (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- ALCOA+ data integrity compliance (Contemporaneous = per-sprint harden)
- ROSIE RFC-001 compatible artifact system
- Agent-agnostic (works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, Copilot)
- Single file at project root — agents discover by convention
- YAML frontmatter for machine-readable config
- Markdown body for behavioral instructions using RFC 2119 keywords

## Built-in Regulatory Profiles
- pharma-standard: 21 CFR Part 11, EU Annex 11, ICH Q7/Q9/Q10, GAMP 5
- medical-device: IEC 62304, ISO 13485, FDA 21 CFR 820
- clinical-trial: ICH E6(R2), 21 CFR Part 11, GDPR
- laboratory: 21 CFR Part 58 (GLP), ISO 17025

## Ecosystem
- ROSIE RFC-001: Artifact/evidence standard that GxP.MD wraps
- Nexus: GxP validation platform that consumes GxP.MD contracts

## Optional
- [llms-full.txt](https://gxp.md/llms-full.txt): Complete specification in plain text
